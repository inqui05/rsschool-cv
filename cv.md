## About me:

I have little experience working with websites on the wordpress and in search engine optimization (as a hobby). Sometimes I had to change something in the site and I looked for an information. I've decided to learn more and do js/html/css courses. In the process I realized I like coding. So I stopped my hobbies and now I'm spending time just on my job, my English course and learning html/css/js. I want to learn a lot of new thing, get experience of development and become a frontend developer.
I have ability lo learn, perseverance and love solving difficult task.
